00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,825
Look upon this world with wonder. The mountains, proud and

2
00:00:05,825 --> 00:00:11,650
resolute, standing like timeless sentinels against the backdrop of cerulean

00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:17,475
eternity. Their grey-green mantles kissed by the snow and cradled

00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:23,300
by the heavens, each peak a testament to nature's artistic

00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:29,126
prowess. Our souls find a solemn echo in these serene

00:00:29,126 --> 00:00:34,951
fields of green stretching yonder, a verdant tapestry woven with

7
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:40,776
the warp and weft of life and light. Here, the

00:00:40,776 --> 00:00:46,601
air dances with the quiet resilience of the earth, whispering

00:00:46,601 --> 00:00:52,427
stories carried on the wings of the wind. Our hearts

10
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:58,252
echo their song - a hymn to the enduring beauty

11
00:00:58,252 --> 00:01:00,000
of our world.
