00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,122
Witness the magnificent ballet, the unscripted dance of life that

2
00:00:06,122 --> 00:00:12,244
unfolds on the platform of everyday existence. Itâ€™s a dance

3
00:00:12,244 --> 00:00:18,367
of fleeting moments, where people, like living metronomes, synchronize with

4
00:00:18,367 --> 00:00:24,489
the heartbeat of steel beasts we call trains. They chase,

5
00:00:24,489 --> 00:00:30,612
they race, hearts pulsating, breaths held, lives in their briefcases.

6
00:00:30,612 --> 00:00:36,734
They run not just for a train, but for dreams

7
00:00:36,734 --> 00:00:42,857
contained within the minutes they reclaim, for opportunities just a

8
00:00:42,857 --> 00:00:48,979
platform away. Remember this: success or failure is not dictated

9
00:00:48,979 --> 00:00:55,102
by the trains we miss, but by the tenacity of

10
00:00:55,102 --> 00:01:00,000
our spirit to chase the next one relentlessly.
