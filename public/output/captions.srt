00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,724
In the theater of existence, mountains stand like ancient sculptures.

2
00:00:04,724 --> 00:00:09,448
They are the masterpieces of Mother Nature's artistry, coarse yet

3
00:00:09,448 --> 00:00:14,173
dazzling, bleak but resplendent. Every crag, cliff, and crevice holds

4
00:00:14,173 --> 00:00:18,897
a story - aeons of solitude and stillness, of winds

5
00:00:18,897 --> 00:00:23,622
whispering secrets to stoic peaks. Mountains stand as sentinels to

6
00:00:23,622 --> 00:00:28,346
time, silent witnesses of countless sunrises and sunsets, shrouded in

7
00:00:28,346 --> 00:00:33,070
a cloak of sage wisdom that only the echoes of

8
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:37,795
eternity can reveal. As we climb further towards the heavens,

9
00:00:37,795 --> 00:00:42,519
so too does our spirit ascend, leaving the mundane far

10
00:00:42,519 --> 00:00:47,244
behind. Before us stands not simply a mountain, but the

11
00:00:47,244 --> 00:00:51,968
manifestation of lifeâ€™s grandeur. Let us look upon these natural

12
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:56,692
wonders with a sense of awe and respect so that

13
00:00:56,692 --> 00:01:00,000
they continue to inspire generations yet unborn.
