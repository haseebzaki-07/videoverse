1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,451
In the theatre of the wild, a spectacle unfolds. Behold

2
00:00:06,451 --> 00:00:12,903
running horses, flowing manes shimmering in the snap of the

3
00:00:12,903 --> 00:00:19,354
wind like silver waves in a sea of oats. The

4
00:00:19,354 --> 00:00:25,806
symphony of their hooves hits the earth in staccato beats,

5
00:00:25,806 --> 00:00:32,258
echoing the ancestral pulse of freedom. Each stride, every proud,

6
00:00:32,258 --> 00:00:38,709
untamed spirit, painting a poem of power, of relentless pursuit.

7
00:00:38,709 --> 00:00:45,161
We bear witness to their running, thundering across the open

8
00:00:45,161 --> 00:00:51,612
plain, our breath stolen in awe. Theirs is the song

9
00:00:51,612 --> 00:00:58,064
of the wild, a testament to endurance and existence, encapsulating

10
00:00:58,064 --> 00:01:00,000
life's majestic symphony.
