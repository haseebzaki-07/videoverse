1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,411
In the world, there exists a symphony of laughter and

2
00:00:04,411 --> 00:00:08,823
joy which echoes with purity and innocence, a symphony spun

3
00:00:08,823 --> 00:00:13,235
by children at play. Imagine delicate sunbeams dancing on their

4
00:00:13,235 --> 00:00:17,647
cherub faces, as they summon worlds from water puddles, castles

5
00:00:17,647 --> 00:00:22,058
from sand. Look, as they craft tales of heroes and

6
00:00:22,058 --> 00:00:26,470
villains, drawn not from the pages of books, but the

7
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:30,882
limitless canvas of their imagination. Each leaf, a ship sailing

8
00:00:30,882 --> 00:00:35,294
uncharted waters; each twig, a wand with powers unknown. Visualize

9
00:00:35,294 --> 00:00:39,705
their wide-eyed wonder, tasting the magic of existence, unmarred by

10
00:00:39,705 --> 00:00:44,117
the shadows of the world. Amidst childhood's carefree symphony, we

11
00:00:44,117 --> 00:00:48,529
recall the pulse of our own lost adventures, the bounds

12
00:00:48,529 --> 00:00:52,941
of our forgotten wonder. In their laughter, a mirror to

13
00:00:52,941 --> 00:00:57,352
our past, a beacon for our future, a tribute to

14
00:00:57,352 --> 00:01:00,000
the eternal magic of the present.
