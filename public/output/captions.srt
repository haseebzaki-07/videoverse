In the silent echo of time, humanity evolved from fire

00:00:05,309 --> 00:00:10,619
lit caves to global connectivity on the edge of our

00:00:10,619 --> 00:00:15,929

00:00:53,097 --> 00:00:58,407
of tomorrow, sculpting a symphony of connections. Long live this

00:00:58,407 --> 00:01:00,000
saga of progress.
