00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,444
Ladies and gentlemen, stand witness to humanity’s tenacity, ingenuity, and

2
00:00:04,444 --> 00:00:08,888
willpower manifest — construction. It begins as an intangible mirage,

3
00:00:08,888 --> 00:00:13,333
crafted in the vibrant minds of architects and engineers, spun

4
00:00:13,333 --> 00:00:17,777
into a web of innovation and daring possibility. Then, the

5
00:00:17,777 --> 00:00:22,222
symphony of machinery awakens, transforming these unseen castles in the

6
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:26,666
sky into concrete reality. Like mighty sculptors, we shape iron,

7
00:00:26,666 --> 00:00:31,111
steel, stone, competing against nature and time. Every brick, every

8
00:00:31,111 --> 00:00:35,555
beam, a testament to human strength, our perceived limitations crumble,

9
00:00:35,555 --> 00:00:39,999
and in their place, we erect monoliths worthy of remembrance.

10
00:00:39,999 --> 00:00:44,444
These towering silhouettes, ladies and gentlemen, are not mere structures.

11
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:48,888
They symbolize dreams brought to life by the dedicated heartbeats

12
00:00:48,888 --> 00:00:53,333
of countless laborers, providing comfort, safety, and beauty. To build

13
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:57,777
is to bid defiance to the ephemerality of existence, creating

14
00:00:57,777 --> 00:01:00,000
something everlasting, something monumental, something...human.
